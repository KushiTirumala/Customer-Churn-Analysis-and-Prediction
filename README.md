# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

An end-to-end Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction project using Python. The project focuses on identifying patterns that lead to customer churn and building a simple predictive model to help businesses reduce customer attrition.


## Project Overview

Customer churn directly impacts business revenue. This project analyzes customer data to:
- Identify churn patterns and key drivers
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Build and evaluate a predictive churn model
- Communicate insights using visualizations



## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess customer datasets
- Analyze customer behavior related to churn
- Visualize churn patterns and trends
- Build a basic churn prediction model
- Provide actionable business insights

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – predictive modeling
